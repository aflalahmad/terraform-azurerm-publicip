# Public IP Module

## What is a Public IP?
A public IP address is a unique IP address assigned to your Azure resource that allows it to communicate with other resources over the Internet. Public IPs are used for communication between Azure resources and the external world, enabling scenarios such as web hosting, VPN connections, and API services. This module facilitates the creation and management of public IP addresses in Azure.
